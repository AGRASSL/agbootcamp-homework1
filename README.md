# Horiseon
Horiseon webpage is a tool for Northwester's Coding Bootcamp in order to understand the reasoning behind webpage accessibility as well as learning how to clean up CSS and HTML files using logical sections and attributes.

# Motivation
Accessibility of web pages falls right in line with the Americans with Disabilities act that ensures that all individuals should have the same access and rights to using the internet as everyone else. Providing accessibility attributes provides the ability for page readers to inform any individual what the pictures on the page represent. Consolidating and organizing stylesheets creates an environment where other developers can review and help improve a website with your given code. It also is beneficial for troubleshooting any issues while deploying a project.

# Contribute
Any contributions to make the HTML or CSS are very welcome.

# Credits
Credit and inspiration to this project goes to Northwestern's Bootcamp and the instructors.
